    <h1>Samsons class</h1>
    <p>Samson is an interesting lecturer I must say. Starting us off with the introduction to software engineering. When
        he started to write the html, I was huh things are getting real. It was quite an interesting thing because as a
        first-time coder I was pretty amazed. Wile using the w3 schools website it was quite easy to get the concepts.
