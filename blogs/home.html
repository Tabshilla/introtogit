        <h2 style="background-color: bisque;">Exploring The World Of Code</h2>
        <p>Adong Tabshilla Maureen is a vibrant young lady intrigued by the evolving world and
            its structures. As a recent graduate from Makerere University and how complex it was to
            secure an employment opportunity, I was pushed to the corner to look at what other
            opportunities were there for the youth in this ever-changing world.</p>
        <p>Being a first-time coder has been quite interesting if I must say. The concepts are
            friendly if you pay a close attention to what Samson Kapeyi has to say and what he is
            doing. I am an innovative soul after persuing a bachelors degree in Entrreneurship and
            Buainess management, I am always look for away of adding something to an already
            existing product.</p>
        <p>I am a hardworking individual with the ability to “serve to masers at once”. I am a good
            listener always keen to pick out important points. I am highly adaptive of the
            environments I am put in. I am friendly as it gives me joy to make friends. I am also
            kind and I would love to believe so. I love to make people around me happy</p>
        <p>I am excited about this new journey and I pray it yields good results. Being a backend
            developer sems pretty cool and I can’t wait to explore it more. I have a dream of
            working in Microsoft because I think it is pretty cool.dont you agree
